    \section{ducc\_reserve}

    \paragraph{Description:}
    The reserve CLI is used request a reservation of resources. Reservations can be for entire 
    machines or partial machines, based on memory requirements. All reservations are persistent: 
    the resources remain dedicated to the requestor until explicitly returned. All reservations are 
    performeed on an "all-or-nothing" basis: either the entire set of requested resources is reserved, 
    or the reservation request fails. 

    All forms of ducc\_reserve block until the reservation is complete (or fails) at which point the DUCC
    ID of the reservation and the names of the reserved nodes are printed to the console and the
    command returns.

    \paragraph{Usage:}
        \begin{description}
        \item[Script wrapper] \ducchome/bin/ducc\_reserve {\em options}
        \item[Java Main]      java -cp \ducchome/lib/uima-ducc-cli.jar org.apache.uima.ducc.cli.DuccReservationSubmit {\em options}
        \end{description}

    \paragraph{Options:}
    
        \begin{description}

            \item[$--$debug ]          
              Prints internal debugging information, intended for DUCC developers or extended problem determination.
              
            \item[$--$description {[text]}]               
              The text is any string used to describe the reservation. It is displayed in the Web Server. 
              
            \item[$--$help ]             
              Prints the usage text to the console. 
                            
            \item[$--$instance\_memory\_size {[integer]}]               
              This specifies the amount of memory the reserved machine must support. For full machine 
              reservations, this is the total memory on the machine. For partial reservations, the machine 
              may have more memory, but not less than is specified. 

            \item[$--$number\_of\_instances {[integer]}]               
              This specifies the number of full or partial machine reservations to schedule. 
                            
            \item[$--$scheduling\_class {[classname]}]               
              This specifies the name of the scheuling class the RM will use to determine the resource 
              allocation for each process. The default DUCC distribution provides class "reserve" for full 
              machine reservations, and "fixed" for partial machine reservations. 
              
            \item[$-$f, $--$specification {[file]}]               
              All the parameters used to request a reservation may be placed in a standard Java 
              properties file. This file may then be used to submit the request (rather than providing all 
              the parameters directory to submit). 

        \end{description}
            
    \paragraph{Notes:}
    Reservations may be for full machines, or partial machines based on memory. The mechanism for
    distinguishing which type of reservation is the job class. A job class implementing the RESERVE
    scheduling policy results in a full machine being reserved. A job clas simplementing the FIXED
    scheduling policy results in a partial machine being reserved. The default DUCC distribution
    configures class {\em reserve} for full machine reservations, and class {\em fixed} for partial
    machine reservations.
