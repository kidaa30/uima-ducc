\section{Managed Reservation Details Page}
\label{sec:ws-managed-reservation-details}

This page shows details of the processes which run in a managed reservation.  The
information is divided between two tabs:

   \begin{description}
       \item[Processes] This tab contains details on all the proceses contained in the
         reserved space.
       \item[Specification] This tab shows the specification for the process.
   \end{description}  

   \subsection{Processes}
   \label{sec:ws-manres-processes}

   The processes page contains the following columns:
   \begin{description}
      \item[ID] \hfill \\
        This is the DUCC-assigned numeric id of the process.  This format of this
        id is two numbers:
\begin{verbatim}
    RESID.SHAREID
\end{verbatim}
        Here, the {\em RESID} is the reservation ID.  The {\em SHAREID} is the 
        share ID assigned by the Resource Manager.  Together these form a unique
        ID for each process that runs in the reservation.
        
        Note: The current version of DUCC supports only one process per managed
        reservation.  Future versions are expected to support multiple processes
        within a single managed reservation.
        
      \item[Log] \hfill \\
        This is the log name for the process. It is hyperlinked to the log itself.
        
      \item[Size] \hfill \\
        This is the size of the log in MB. If you find you have trouble viewing the log
        from the web server it could be because it is too big to view in the browser.
        
      \item[Hostname] \hfill \\
        This is the name of the node where the process is running (or ran).
        
      \item[PID] \hfill \\
        This is the Unix process ID (PID) of the process.
        
      \item[State Scheduler] \hfill \\
        This shows the Resesource Manager state of the job. It is one of:
        
        \begin{description}
            \item[Allocated] - The node is still allocated for this job by the RM.
            \item[Deallocated] - The resource manager has deallocated the shares for the job on
              this node.
        \end{description}
        
      \item[Reason Scheduler or Extraordinary Status] \hfill \\
        These are the same as for the \hyperref[itm:job-details-sched]{job details.}

      \item[State Agent] \hfill \\
        These are the same as for the \hyperref[itm:job-details-state]{job details.}

      \item[Reason Agent] \hfill \\
        These are the same as for the \hyperref[itm:job-details-agent]{job details.}

      \item[Time Run] \hfill \\
        The current duration of the reservation, or total duration if it has 
        terminated.
        
      \item[RSS] \hfill \\
        The amount of real memory being consumed by the process (Resident Storage Size)

   \end{description}

   \subsection{Specification}
   \label{sec:ws-service-specification}
   This tab shows the full job specification in the form of a Java Properties
   file.  This will include all the parameters specified by the user, plus those
   filled in by DUCC.
